# Hi there, I'm Maham Jamil! 👋 
🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in **Mathematics** with majors in **Data Science and Machine Learning**.  
I have a strong analytical foundation and a growing hands-on focus on applying machine learning and AI techniques to real-world problems. My academic background in mathematics helps me understand the **logic, statistics, and optimization** behind ML algorithms rather than treating them as black boxes. I’m actively learning, building projects, and exploring areas of **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on practical implementation and continuous improvement.

💻 I’m currently strengthening my skills in:
- Python programming for data analysis and ML
- Machine Learning (supervised & unsupervised models)
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Building end-to-end ML projects (from data to deployment)
- Deep Learning fundamentals

🌱I believe in learning by building, making mistakes, and improving step by step.
